Interactive Interface: Users can enter their answers in text fields next to each image.
Real-time Validation: The game provides immediate feedback on the correctness of the answers.
Alert Box: A success alert box appears when all answers are correct, and users can close it to proceed.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling of the page (Bootstrap and custom styles).
JavaScript: Dynamic content handling and answer validation.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for styling and layout.

Randomization Technique
The game uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to randomize the order of function descriptions and correct answers. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of how it works:

Initialization: Two arrays, functionDescriptions and correctAnswers, are shuffled to ensure the descriptions and answers are matched in a random order.
Algorithm: The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm iterates through the arrays from the end to the beginning, swapping each element with a randomly selected earlier element. This ensures each permutation of the arrays is equally likely.
This technique provides a fair and unbiased randomization, ensuring that each game session is unique and challenging.
